                <h2>A little bit of Nicola Tesla</h2>
                <p>He was a Serbian-American engineer and physicist who made dozens of breakthroughs in the production,
                    transmission and application of electric power.</p>
                <p>
                    Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, 1856.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His father was a priest in the Serbian Orthodox church and his mother managed the family’s farm.

            <h2>Things probably you did not know</h2>
            <p>
                Tesla designed the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which is still the predominant electrical system used
                across the world today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tesla also created the "Tesla coil," which is still used in radio technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tesla and Thomas Edison grew to be fierce competitors, but in the end, Edison had the upper hand during their lifetimes.
